# Rock-Paper-Siccors
Rock-Paper-Siccors is a single-player version of the classic game!

## Project Details
Making a Rock-Paper-Siccors game was an exercise in *Learning App Development with Swift* offered through iBooks.

The game opens up on the start screen, which features a robot icon and the three answer choices. A random number generator that returns a number between 1 and 3 determines the robot's alternative of choice. Depending on the game state: win, lose or draw, a different emoji will be presented between the two choices detailing wether you won, lost or tied. At the bottom is a button that says 'Play Again'.

## Takeaways

This taught my 3-year-old neice, who was proficient with smart devices, how to play rock paper siccors. When I read the words across the win, lose, and draw game states she woud do the same, likely controlled by the emoji, perhaps by comparing the choices made, but I was unable to test that. She loves to play this game and rock-paper-siccors in person to this day.

Thanks for taking a look!
